nucular reactor for D
=====================
**nucular** is an easy to use reactor inspired by [EventMachine](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine).

You can find some examples in the `examples/` directory.

License exceptions
------------------
I know many hate AGPL, especially in libraries, but I hereby give permission to use the library
for network related services with any license you see fit, **as long as you give back changes
to the actual library**.

What I mean is, if you just use the library and the already implemented protocols to implement
some kind of service, you don't have to put your service under AGPL, but if you make changes to
the already implemented protocols or internals of the library, I want those changes back.
